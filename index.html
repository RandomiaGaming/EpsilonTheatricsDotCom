      EpsilonTheatrics is small theater tech startup created by Finlay Christ.
      We are in the process of developing a peice of software called PowerCues which will allow users to program theater
      lighting cues using an cross intuative UI. PowerCues currently supports the ETC Gadget DMX interface and we plan
      to support more in interfaces in the future.
      PowerCues also runs on both Windows and Linux using the <a href="https://github.com/chromiumembedded/cef#readme">chromium embeddable framework</a>.
      Development is slow due to college classwork taking my time but I am dedicated to this project.
      If you are intrested in supporting me in this project or have questions please reach out at <a

      Development Update 06/24/2025: I got the driver fully working including adding tons of documentation. I also made
      the big decision to create a GUI instead of just a command line tool. Started working on replacing the V8
      javascript engine with the Chromium Embeddable Framework (CEF) to allow for a propper HTML GUI. Additionally
      PowerCues now runs on Linux with minimal dependencies so you can use it on almost any distro. I feel that public
      beta 1.0 is getting closer by the day. Once I fix some issues with CEF I should be ready to ship a public release
      (finally).

      Development Update 11/18/2024: I managed to afford an ETC Nomad. From there I was able to reverse engineer the
      communication protocol used by the ETC Gadget over USB and reimplamented it in my own driver.
      PowerCues can now officially send dmx states over usb to lights! Next I compiled and set up the V8 JavaScript
      engine and got it working in a simple testing enviroment. So you can officially control lights with JavaScript.
      There is much work to be done before this PowerCues will be ready for use in a real theatrical production but I'm
      very happy with current progress. My future plans are to fix bugs in the main engine and ensure it is stable then
      get to work on the animation and cue system.

      Development Update 2/4/2024: Project is still in active development but funding is tight and DMX hardware is
      expensive. Development will continue more officially when I can afford an ETC Nomad.
